# PackagingBox Measurement

## Dimensioning and Weighing Solutions using Depth AI

In the world of warehousing, `space = money` and `high labour cost = lesser profits.` Warehouse problems can affect the speed, efficiency, and productivity of either one particular warehouse operation or the entire chain of processes that are linked with it. Packaging operations have always been a real time-thief in warehouses and often almost completely manual. Often it is a real bottleneck in the warehouse flow. A half-hour before the trucks leave the warehouse, there is usually chaos in the packaging area with staff running into each other, looking for the right boxes and packing material to finish in time. This also affects the quality with the mixing of the goods from different orders as a result. Choosing the right package dimension size hep you to prevent costs of unncessary filling materials.

## Operation packaging efficiency is direct result of:
- Correct product packaging dimension measurement, combined with
- Right packaging materials and
- Operational procedures,

These factors, when implemented diligently, can help you manage packages by reducing damages and satisfy your customers through high operational standards. 
From small boxes to large pallets, our solution enables logistics companies to better manage their inventory and shipments.

## Scope of the project:
- Using OAK-D 3D Stereo Vision camera for capturing measurements of package, box or parcel. 
- Measure how much storage space the object would need or determine what size of the carton to use for shipment, estimate shipping costs.
- Use AI-enabled add-ons such as open, leaking, and broken box detection and packaging optimization to improve workforce efficiency and safety.
